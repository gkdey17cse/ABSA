# Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis

#### Asignment - 2 | Task - 2 | By - Gour Krishna Dey | Roll - MT24035 | IIITD

## How to Run the Project

In the zip File we get Directory Structure as-

```bash
Deliverables/
│-- Requirements/
| |-- fasttext_embeddings_25.pkl
| |-- RNN_Local_Context_Class.py
│-- RNN_Local_Context.pth
│-- task2.ipynb
│-- train_task_2.json
│-- val_task_2.json
```

To use preprocess the json file and make it compatible with our pipeline we need to run the `task2.ipynb` script (details are written inside) . This script has two dependencies `fasttext_embeddings_25.pkl` (embeddings of entire vocab) & `RNN_Local_Context_Class.py` which are kept in `Requirements/` directory . Our best baseline model is `RNN_Local_Context.pth` which will be loaded while running task2.ipynb and you could see the final accuracy .
N.B - The user given .json file must have json object like -

```json
{
  "sentence_id": "2474",
  "sentence": "The food is alright - some stuff is good - some is not (like the steak dish which tends to be dry).",
  "aspect_terms": [
    {
      "term": "food",
      "polarity": "conflict",
      "from": "4",
      "to": "8"
    },
    {
      "term": "steak dish",
      "polarity": "negative",
      "from": "65",
      "to": "75"
    }
  ],
  "aspect_categories": [
    {
      "category": "food",
      "polarity": "conflict"
    }
  ]
}
```

## 1. Data Preprocessing, Vocabulary Generation, and Embeddings Creation

### 1.1 **Data Preprocessing**

The first step in our pipeline is preprocessing, which is handled in the `preprocessing.ipynb` file. The goal of this step is to clean and structure the raw JSON data to make it suitable for further processing. We follow these steps:

- **Load the data**: The input JSON file is read into a pandas DataFrame for easy manipulation.
- **Tokenization**: Each sentence is tokenized using NLTK’s `word_tokenize` function, breaking it down into individual words.
- **Punctuation Removal**: We remove any punctuation marks to ensure that only meaningful words are retained.
- **Aspect Term Extraction**: For each sentence, we extract aspect terms while keeping track of unique terms to avoid duplication.
- **Polarity and Indexing**: We capture the polarity associated with each aspect term and determine its index position in the tokenized sentence.
- **Save Processed Data**: Finally, the processed information (tokens, polarity, aspect terms, and their positions) is stored in a new JSON file (`train_task_2.json`).

### 1.2. **Vocabulary Generation**

After preprocessing, the next step is to create a vocabulary of all unique words found in the dataset. This is done in the `vocab_generation.ipynb` notebook:

- **Load Processed Data**: We start by reading the preprocessed JSON file.
- **Extract Unique Words**: We collect all unique words from the tokenized sentences and store them in a `set` to remove duplicates.
- **Save Vocabulary**: The final vocabulary list is saved in a text file (`vocab.txt`), where each word is written on a new line. This file will be used in the next step to generate word embeddings.

### 1.3. **Embeddings Creation**

Word embeddings help us represent words as numerical vectors, which are useful for machine learning models. The process of creating embeddings is handled in `embeddings.ipynb` through the following steps:

- **Train FastText Model**: We use the `FastText` library to train a `skipgram` model on the `vocab.txt` file. The embeddings are 15-dimensional.
- **Extract Word Vectors**: The trained model generates a word vector for each word in our vocabulary.
- **Handle Missing Words**: In case a word is not present in the FastText model, we assign it the mean vector of all learned embeddings to ensure consistency in dimensions.
- **Save Embeddings**: The final dictionary of word embeddings is saved in a file (`fasttext_embeddings_25.pkl`) using the `pickle` module.

## 2. Best Model , Model architectures and hyperparameters used

We implemented an RNN-based model with an attention mechanism for aspect-based sentiment analysis.The key idea was to **_focus on the local context around the aspect term (left and right neighbors) rather than processing the entire sentence_**. This approach reduces noise and ensures the model concentrates on the most relevant information for sentiment prediction. The attention mechanism was added to help the model weigh the importance of different parts of the context, improving its ability to capture meaningful patterns.

### 2.1. Hyperparameters Used

- **Embedding Dimension:** 25 (from FastText embeddings).
- **Hidden Dimension:** 64 (for the RNN layer).
- **Output Dimension:** 4 (for the 4 sentiment classes: positive, negative, neutral, conflict).
- **Learning Rate:** 0.0001 (chosen to ensure stable training).
- **Batch Size:** 32 (balanced between computational efficiency and model performance).
- **Epochs:** 20 (sufficient to observe convergence in training and validation loss).

### 2.2. Best Model

The best-performing model was the RNN with attention, as it achieved a validation accuracy of **56.33%**. While the accuracy is moderate, the model demonstrated consistent learning, with training and validation losses decreasing steadily over epochs. The attention mechanism played a crucial role in improving the model's ability to focus on relevant context.

### 2.3. Model Architecture

1. **Input Layer:** Takes the local context embeddings (left and right neighbors of the aspect term) and the aspect term embedding.
2. **RNN Layer:** A single RNN layer with a hidden dimension of 64 to process the sequence of embeddings.
3. **Attention Layer:** Computes attention scores over the RNN outputs to create a weighted context vector.
4. **Fully Connected Layers:** Two fully connected layers (with ReLU activation) to map the context vector to the final output (4 sentiment classes).

### 2.4. Why We Chose This Idea

- **Local Context Focus:** By focusing on the immediate neighbors of the aspect term, we reduced the complexity of the input and ensured the model concentrated on the most relevant information.
- **Attention Mechanism:** This was added to enhance the model's ability to weigh the importance of different parts of the context, making it more robust and interpretable.
- **FastText Embeddings:** These embeddings capture subword information, which is beneficial for handling out-of-vocabulary words and improving generalization.

### 2.5. Experiment With Other Model

During our experimentation, we tried different models (LSTM and RNN) with various techniques (fixed context window, variable context window, local context, and global context) to identify the best-performing approach. Below is a summary of the results:

| Model   | Approach                 | Validation Accuracy |
| ------- | ------------------------ | ------------------- |
| LSTM    | Fixed Context Window (5) | 55.87%              |
| LSTM    | Variable Context Window  | 55.87%              |
| LSTM    | Local Context            | 55.67%              |
| LSTM    | Global Context           | 56.10%              |
| RNN     | Fixed Context Window     | 56.06%              |
| RNN     | Variable Context Window  | 56.33%              |
| **RNN** | **Local Context**        | **56.33%**          |
| RNN     | Global Context           | 56.33%              |

### 2.6. Why We Chose RNN with Local Context

- **Best Accuracy:** The RNN with local context achieved the highest validation accuracy `(56.33%)` among all configurations.
- **Simplicity:** While LSTM models are powerful, they did not outperform RNN in this specific task. RNNs, combined with the attention mechanism, provided a good balance of performance and simplicity.
- **Focus on Local Context:** The local context approach consistently performed well across both LSTM and RNN models, indicating its effectiveness in capturing relevant information around the aspect term.

### 2.7. Final Model Selection

RNN outperformed LSTM due to its simpler architecture, which reduces overfitting on smaller datasets, and its ability to efficiently capture short context dependencies crucial for aspect-based sentiment. Additionally, RNNs has less computational overhead, enabling better convergence within limited epochs. Among context strategies, local context (immediate neighbors) performed best (56.33%) for both RNN and LSTM, as it focuses on the most relevant words, unlike fixed or global contexts. We chose **RNN with local context** as the final model because it achieved the highest accuracy, outperformed LSTM, and aligned well with the task by concentrating on nearby context.

## 3 . Fine tune of BERT , ROBERTa & BART

### 3.1. **Fine-Tuning BERT for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA)**

We fine-tuned BERT for the ABSA task by leveraging the pre-trained `bert-base-uncased` model from the Hugging Face `transformers` library. The dataset was processed by tokenizing the aspect term and the full review text together, ensuring that the model learns contextual relationships between aspects and sentiments.

During fine-tuning, we used:

- Cross-Entropy Loss for classification
- AdamW optimizer for better weight updates
- Learning rate scheduling using a linear scheduler
- Batch size optimization to balance memory usage and performance

#### **Example:**

We formatted the input as `[CLS] aspect [SEP] review text [SEP]`, ensuring that the model attends to both the aspect term and its surrounding context. For instance, if the review is:

> "The battery life of this phone is excellent."
> and the aspect is `battery life`, the tokenized input becomes:
> `[CLS] battery life [SEP] The battery life of this phone is excellent. [SEP]`

Training ran for multiple epochs, and we monitored both training and validation losses to avoid overfitting. After training, we saved the fine-tuned model for further evaluation. Loss plots were generated to visualize training convergence.

### 3.2. **Fine-Tuning BART for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA)**

For BART, we used the `facebook/bart-base` model, which is originally designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks but can be adapted for classification. The training process involved tokenizing the aspect and sentence together, using the same loss function (Cross-Entropy Loss) and optimization techniques as BERT.

BART’s ability to reconstruct masked tokens contributed to learning better contextual relationships in ABSA. We fine-tuned BART by freezing certain layers initially, then gradually unfreezing them to allow for better adaptation without catastrophic forgetting. We also experimented with different learning rates to ensure stable training.

#### **Example:**

For the same example review:

> "The battery life of this phone is excellent."
> and aspect `battery life`, the BART tokenizer converts it into subword tokens and processes it in the encoder-decoder framework. Unlike BERT, BART leverages denoising techniques, which help in reconstructing masked segments to reinforce context learning.

After fine-tuning, the model was evaluated on the validation set, and loss plots were generated to track performance over epochs.

### 3.3. **Fine-Tuning RoBERTa for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA)**

RoBERTa (`roberta-base`) was fine-tuned in a manner similar to BERT but with some modifications. RoBERTa does not use token-type embeddings, so we carefully structured input sequences to differentiate between aspect terms and review texts. We employed:

- A dynamic padding strategy to handle variable-length inputs
- Higher batch sizes due to RoBERTa’s efficient pre-training methodology
- A cyclic learning rate schedule to optimize convergence

#### **Example:**

Unlike BERT, which explicitly marks segments with `[SEP]`, RoBERTa does not use token-type embeddings. Thus, for the same example:

> "The battery life of this phone is excellent."
> RoBERTa processes it as:
> `battery life <s> The battery life of this phone is excellent.</s>`
> This structure allows RoBERTa’s robust masked language modeling to focus on aspect sentiment learning.

RoBERTa demonstrated strong performance due to its robust pre-training techniques, which included training on larger datasets with dynamic masking. The final fine-tuned model was saved after evaluation, and we analyzed its loss trends to ensure training stability.

## 4. **Evaluation of Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis Models `(RNN_local_context , BART , BERT & ROBERTa)`**

### **4.4. Analysis of Results**

#### 4.4.1. RNN_Local_Context:

The RNN-based model struggled to capture the complexity of the task, resulting in underfitting. The validation accuracy plateaued at 56.33%, indicating that the model was unable to generalize well to unseen data.

#### 4.4.2. BERT:

BERT performed significantly better than the RNN model, achieving a validation accuracy of 75.20%. However, the validation loss started increasing after epoch 8, suggesting overfitting. This could be mitigated by using regularization techniques or early stopping.

#### 4.4.3. BART:

BART outperformed all other models, achieving the highest validation accuracy of 80.32%. The model showed consistent improvement in training loss, but the validation loss started increasing after epoch 6, indicating slight overfitting.

#### 4.4.4. RoBERTa:

RoBERTa showed moderate performance with a validation accuracy of 70.35%. The validation loss fluctuated significantly, which could be due to the model's sensitivity to hyperparameters or the dataset's complexity.

### **5. Final Verdict & Conclusion**

- The superior performance of `BART` in aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) can be attributed to its unique architecture, which combines **_bidirectional_** and **_auto-regressive transformers_**. This design enables the model to effectively capture both the contextual relationships and the sequential nature of the text, making it particularly well-suited for tasks like ABSA. Additionally, BART's pre-training on a diverse and extensive corpus allows it to generalize better to unseen data, further enhancing its performance.

- The results of this study highlight that transformer-based models like `BART` and `BERT` significantly outperform traditional `RNN-based models` in ABSA tasks. However, a common **challenge observed with transformer-based models is overfitting**, as evidenced by the fluctuating validation loss in BERT and BART. This underscores the importance of careful hyperparameter tuning, regularization techniques, and early stopping to mitigate overfitting and improve generalization.

- While `RoBERTa` showed moderate performance, its validation loss exhibited significant fluctuations, suggesting that further optimizations, such as hyperparameter tuning or alternative fine-tuning strategies, could enhance its effectiveness. Our future work should explore advanced fine-tuning techniques, data augmentation, and alternative architectures to further improve model generalization and robustness in ABSA tasks.

In conclusion, this study demonstrates the effectiveness of transformer-based models like BART, BERT, and RoBERTa in ABSA, while also identifying key challenges and opportunities for future research. By addressing these challenges, such as overfitting and model optimization, we can continue to advance the state-of-the-art in sentiment analysis and related NLP tasks. The comparison with the RNN_Local_Context baseline further emphasizes the superiority of pre-trained transformer models in handling complex NLP tasks like ABSA.
